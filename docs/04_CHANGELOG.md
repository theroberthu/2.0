## Release 1.6 - Consulting CTA removal from article bodies (2026-08-21)

**What changed.** Removed retired consulting calls to action, client
testimonials, service pricing, and links to retired service pages from **63 of
74 published article bodies** in Supabase (`scripts/cleanup-consulting-ctas.mjs`).

Operations applied:
- 46 whole CTA paragraphs deleted ("book a free 15-minute strategy session",
  "an e-commerce strategy consultation can help you").
- 17 paragraphs trimmed at sentence level, preserving the "For more on X, see
  <blog link>" sentences that shared those paragraphs.
- 11 client-testimonial blocks removed (two markup variants: an outer
  `div.blog-testimonial-cta` and a nested `div.blog-testimonial-block`).
- 58 `/services/*` links unwrapped, keeping the anchor text as plain prose.
- 2 service-pricing mentions ($499 audit) removed.

**Why.** The Operating System's first hard rule bans lead forms and
"book a call" / consultation CTAs. The Archive and Evolve pass covered routes,
metadata, and structured data but never touched article bodies, so the CTAs were
live on roughly 85% of published posts. 48 of them linked to
`/free-strategy-session`, which is archived and returns 404.

**Impact.** Site-wide scan now reports **0 hits** for
`/free-strategy-session` links, `/services/*` links, "consultation", "strategy
session", "strategy call", testimonial markup, `$499` pricing, and "book a free".
All 74 published posts have balanced `<p>`, `<div>`, and `<a>` tags with no empty
paragraphs or orphaned headings. No replacement CTA was inserted: every article
already renders the "Follow the research" newsletter banner plus an inline
newsletter card, so the consulting CTAs were pure duplication.

**Deliberately kept.** Three RecoScope product mentions (own product, not a
consultation) had only their trailing "Or book a strategy session" sentence
removed.

**Rollback.** Full pre-change snapshot of all 74 rows:
`backups/blog_posts-backup-2026-08-21.json`.

**Follow-ups.** `amazon-advertising-strategy-2026` retains third-person
credential framing ("Robert Hu has spent over 20 years watching brands make this
mistake"). It is not a CTA, so it was left alone; review for tone separately.

## Release 1.5 - Dead URL and Redirect Cleanup

**Release date:** 2026-07-26. Commit `7098408`.

**What changed.** GA4 landing-page data surfaced 42 sessions (about 6.5% of all
sessions) arriving on 404s at roughly 0% engagement, plus redirects that chained
or resolved into dead ends. Most of that traffic was Direct, meaning stale
external links rather than search results.

- `/free-strategy-session` -> `/about`. The retired consulting page was still
  drawing 12 sessions from external links such as the email signature and
  LinkedIn.
- `/blog/amazon-lens-live-ai-visual-search` -> `/geo/alexa-for-shopping`,
  `/blog/journey-ecom-ai` -> `/blog/ai-compresses-messy-middle-ecommerce`, and
  `/blog/how-to-start-online-business` -> `/blog`. All three predate the 2.0
  rebuild and exist in neither Supabase nor the repository.
- `/case-studies`, `/case-studies/` and `/case-studies/:slug*` -> `/about`. The
  route was archived and returned 404, and the trailing-slash rule redirected
  into that 404.
- Removed two redirect chains: `/geo-audit/results` and `/services/` now point
  straight at their destinations.
- Legacy service slugs repointed from the noindex `/services/*` sub-pages to
  live editorial destinations, so inbound links no longer dead-end for search or
  land readers on consulting copy.
- Corrected the stale `utm-tagging-guide.md` header, which still named the
  retired strategy-session page as the primary CTA.

**Analytical note.** Site-wide engagement of 24.73% and 14s average is not a
usable editorial baseline, because it blends 404 traffic, `(not set)` sessions,
and low-quality Direct. Segmented, Organic Search landing on live article pages
runs roughly 57% engagement and 45 seconds. That is the baseline for judging
article changes. Identical pages also behave very differently by channel (the
homepage at 71.4% Organic versus 17.5% Direct), which points to traffic quality
rather than content quality.

**Still open.** No key events are configured, so related-content clicks,
newsletter clicks, and scroll depth are unmeasurable. GA4's automatic `scroll`
event fires at 90% depth and may already provide a retroactive completion
baseline. The remaining dead URLs beyond the visible top 15 of 145 landing-page
rows have not yet been enumerated.

## Release 1.4 - Mobile Article Recirculation and Progress

**Release date:** 2026-07-26. Commit `68e8a2a`.

**Affected template:** `/blog/[slug]`, applying to all 68 published articles.

**What changed.** Mobile-only changes to the article template. Desktop layout
unchanged.

- Compact Related Research list below `md`. Three stacked image cards become a
  divider-separated list (category, title, read time), so all three next-reads
  fit in roughly one viewport instead of two screens of images. Desktop keeps
  the card grid via `hidden md:grid`.
- New `ReadingProgress` component: a mobile-only progress bar measured against
  the `<article>` element, so it completes at the end of the reading rather than
  after the related posts and footer. Hidden at `xl:`, matching the existing
  `MobileTocCard` and `FloatingBookCta` convention.
- "All Posts" back link raised from a 20px to a 44px tap target
  (`py-3 md:py-0`).

**Mobile breakpoint behavior.** Compact list below 768px; card grid at 768px and
above; progress bar below 1280px.

**Why.** A 390x844 audit found the article page running 11.4 screens with the
Related Research block sitting 69% down the page as 1,719px of stacked image
cards, and no scroll progress feedback. Measuring Quanta Magazine at the same
width showed near-identical body type (16px, 350px column, 39 chars/line), which
disproved the initial hypothesis that mobile type was too small. The real
difference was recirculation: Quanta surfaces 22 of 47 internal links above the
50% depth mark. Revised diagnosis: the article asks readers to make their
next-content decision too late and presents that decision inefficiently on
mobile.

**Expected behavioral impact.** Improved end-of-article choice surface and
scroll orientation on mobile. Estimated ~1,350px (roughly 1.6 screens) removed
from the recirculation block.

**Deliberately excluded.** A mobile line-height change from 1.8 to 1.85 was
implemented and then reverted: typography was not the issue, and extra leading
lengthens an already-long page against the primary goal. Mid-article
recirculation was deferred pending behavioral evidence on where readers abandon,
since the article already carries one newsletter interruption. A mobile footer
trim (939px, 1.1 screens) was logged but not touched.

**Known measurement limitations.** No custom pre-change baseline exists for
related-content click-through or scroll depth. GA4 may supply directional
historical scroll and exit context only. Metrics to track from here:
related-content click-through, article completion and deepest-scroll, newsletter
interaction, mobile versus desktop recirculation, and article-page exits.

**Follow-ups.** Device review on a real phone and tablet, since this shipped
straight to production rather than through a preview. Specifically inspect
whether `ReadingProgress` should be structurally anchored beneath the header
instead of relying on `fixed top-[71px]` against a 72px header, which is brittle
if the header height changes. Then instrument article analytics and use
post-launch data as a directional baseline.

**Framing note.** Missing progress feedback is treated as a plausible usability
improvement, not a proven abandonment cause. The evidence supports the former
only.

## Release 1.3 - Documentation and Operating System

**What changed.** Established `/docs` as the project's source of truth: an
Operating System document, an Editorial Style Guide, a Roadmap (Now/Next/Later/
Future), a prioritized Backlog, and this Changelog. Rewrote `CLAUDE.md` to route
every session into the docs and to reflect the editorial (not consulting)
direction.

**Why.** The repository had been repositioned faster than it was documented.
New AI sessions needed a single, accurate context so the direction stays
coherent over time.

**Impact.** Future work starts from shared standards (flagship page shape,
voice, terminology, what we do not do) instead of re-deriving them.

**Follow-ups.** Reconcile the flagship-standard variances now recorded in the
backlog (`/geo` ending label and schema type; "In Short" primer).

---

## Release 1.2 - Consulting Cleanup

**What changed.**
- Retired `/geo-audit`; deleted the route and permanently redirected it to
  `/geo` (`3ae18b8`).
- Converted `/aeo` into a flagship editorial resource: removed the newsletter/
  CTA ending, added the Key Takeaways + Continue Exploring + Last Updated
  ending, an "In Short" primer, and fixed the SEO/GEO/AEO tagline spacing
  (`ffc8d45`).
- Retired the `/services` index (redirect to `/`), deleted `PricingCarousel`,
  fixed the legacy contact/booking redirects (`/contact`, `/book-a-call`,
  `/consultation`, etc.) that pointed at the archived `/free-strategy-session`
  to point at `/about`, and removed the stale "GEO Audit" consulting project
  from `/work` (`3be59e4`).

**Why.** Remaining consulting/service infrastructure created strategic drift and
broken redirects that no longer fit an editorial publication.

**Impact.** No live service pages, pricing, or booking paths. Legacy URLs
resolve to editorial destinations instead of 404s. `/aeo` matches the flagship
standard.

**Follow-ups.** `/services/*` sub-pages remain noindex/archived; dormant lead
API and email templates still carry consulting copy (see backlog Critical).

## Release 1.1 - Editorial Foundation

**What changed.**
- Repositioned the **homepage** as a research notebook with a featured-post
  focal point (`ca830bf`, `a55837f`, `ae6110f`).
- Rewrote **/about** as a research philosophy rather than a resume (`65a46de`,
  `6e095e6`).
- Repositioned the **footer** as a research-site footer (`d30d5c6`).
- Scrubbed consulting positioning from **metadata and JSON-LD** site-wide, set
  the writing/research positioning, dropped Services from the nav schema, and
  removed embedded YouTube (`2549fee`, `7de9a6a`, `cc5c780`, `b2fe4fc`,
  `7dff4ce`, `23ae615`).
- Gave **blog posts** the research article structure and an automatic
  category-based "Related Research" cluster; repositioned the article newsletter
  CTA to an invitation to follow the research; removed the related-service promo
  block (`88b867b`, `a558947`, `b8e5740`).
- Converted **/geo** into the first flagship editorial resource, with a dedicated
  OG card and tightened `Article` structured data (`a89eff1`, `ca59f46`,
  `7bd6bca`).
- Ran the **Archive and Evolve** transition on the consulting service pages
  (noindex, out of sitemap, content preserved) and made the newsletter the sole
  site CTA (`aab897c`, `7053fe3`).

**Why.** Shift the site's identity from consulting/lead-gen to an editorial AI
Commerce publication built on original research.

**Impact.** Home, About, footer, blog, and the first flagship (`/geo`) all read
as a publication. Structured data and metadata reinforce the research
positioning for search and AI systems.

**Follow-ups.** Consolidated into Release 1.2 (finish retiring consulting
infrastructure).
